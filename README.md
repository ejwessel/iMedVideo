# iMedVideo #

iMedVideo is from the UCI MedAppJam Fall 2014. The team comprised of 2 med students, 4 programmers, and 1 business major. Our task was to help solve issues regarding anything medical. Our response was iMedVideo which we designed to increase medical literacy in patients to save hospitals time and money for readmitted patients. 

The code is strictly a prototype but has been designed to accommodate real development if it were to ever be pursued. While some code would need to be rewritten a lot of the functionality is present.
